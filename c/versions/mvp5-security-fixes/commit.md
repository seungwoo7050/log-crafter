# MVP5: Security & Stability Enhancement

## Overview
Comprehensive security audit and fixes addressing critical vulnerabilities discovered in MVP4.

## Changes Made

### 1. Client Counter Thread Safety (CRITICAL)
- Added `pthread_mutex_t client_count_mutex` to server struct
- Protected all client_count access with mutex lock/unlock
- Fixed race condition where count never decreased on disconnect
- Added proper cleanup in error paths

### 2. Memory Leak Fix in Query Parser (HIGH)
- Fixed memory leak when regex compilation fails
- Added NULL checks after all memory allocations
- Ensured proper cleanup in all error paths

### 3. Safe Integer Parsing (HIGH)
- Replaced all `atoi()` calls with `strtol()` and validation
- Added overflow checks for file size calculations
- Proper error handling for invalid numeric inputs

### 4. Log Message Size Limits (MEDIUM)
- Added `SAFE_LOG_LENGTH` (1024 bytes) to prevent memory exhaustion
- Messages over limit are truncated with "..." indicator
- Prevents malicious clients from sending huge messages

### 5. Error Handling Improvements (MEDIUM)
- Replaced magic numbers with named constants
- Fixed hardcoded buffer sizes (768 â†’ MAX_PATH_LENGTH)
- Consistent error reporting across codebase

## Security Impact

### Before
- Server would permanently refuse connections after 1024 clients connected (ever)
- Memory leaks on invalid regex patterns
- Integer overflow possible causing negative file sizes
- No protection against oversized log messages
- Hardcoded buffer sizes risked overflow

### After
- Proper connection counting with thread-safe increment/decrement
- All memory properly freed in error paths
- Safe integer parsing with overflow protection
- Log messages limited to reasonable size
- Named constants prevent buffer overflows

## Testing
New test suite `test_security.py` verifies:
- Client counter properly tracks connections
- Large logs are truncated
- Invalid inputs handled gracefully
- Concurrent connections work correctly

## Backward Compatibility
All changes maintain full backward compatibility. Existing clients and scripts continue to work unchanged.

## Files Modified
- `include/server.h` - Added client_count_mutex
- `include/log_buffer.h` - Added SAFE_LOG_LENGTH
- `src/server.c` - Thread-safe client counting, log truncation
- `src/query_parser.c` - Memory leak fix, safe integer parsing
- `src/main.c` - Safe integer parsing for CLI args
- `src/persistence.c` - Named constants for buffer sizes
- `tests/test_security.py` - New comprehensive security test suite

## Performance Impact
Minimal - mutex operations add ~100ns per connection, other changes don't affect hot paths.
